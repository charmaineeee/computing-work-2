When a school student recalls a school event or things that happened this year, what they would think of would be HBL. This exactly happened during that time period. 

We had just started on the particulate nature of matter and was feeling very bored as well, physics was boring. 
Surprisingly, Mr Ong, our chemistry teacher animatedly taught us on this topic. 
"You see, solids have a fixed shape and definite volume and thus they vibrate about a fixed position and are packed closely together," 
On the google meet, he explained, while at the same time, vibrating on the spot like he had spasms. 

Many of us started laughing at this point as the gestures he made was so funny. 
He then went on," The liquids slide past each other randomly at a higher speed that of a solid but slower than a gas as the force of attraction between each particles are weaker," 
This time, he "slid" past the screen like he was doing a dance, before moving on to the last state of matter.
â€œThe gas particles zoom past each other as they have extremely weak force of attraction between them,"
As you can expect, he "zoomed" past the camera a couple of times. 

I had not expected that as he explained it so animatedly and interesting that I suddenly felt that this topic was no so bad after all!
The series of actions and moves that he followed suit to explain the PNM subject was different too.

We felt that this topic was exceptionally more interesting, all thanks to Mr Ong's efforts in making class as interesting and inclusive as possible!
