When a school student recalls a school event or things that happened this year, what they would think of would be HBL.

This incident happened during that time period. We had just started on the topic of Particulate Nature of Matter (PNM) and was feeling very bored as we felt that physics was boring.

Surprisingly, Mr Ong, our chemistry teacher taught us this topic, and he did so quite interestingly...

"You see, solids have a fixed shape and definite volume and thus they vibrate closely together," he said, on the google meet, while at the same time, vibrating on the spot like he had the spasms.

Many of us started laughing at this point as the gestures he made were so funny. 

He then went on, "The liquids slide past one another randomly at a higher speed that of a solid as the force of attraction between each particles are weaker, he continued, sliding past the screen like he was doing a dance, before explaining, 

"The gas particles zoom past one another as they have extremely weak force of attraction between them.", before zooming past the camera and back a few times. 

I had not expected that as he explained it so animatedly that I suddenly felt that this topic was not so bad after all. 

The series of actions and moves that followed suit explained that the PNM subject was different too.

As sometimes the topics may get boring, he constantly cracks jokes (although we may not react) and likes to explain concepts to us in a creative manner.(Charmaine's(1H) Idea)
